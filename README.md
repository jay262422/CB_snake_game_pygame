# Snake Game in Python 🐍

This project is a classic Snake Game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**. The implementation follows an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach, showcasing how to structure code efficiently with classes and methods. Inspired by the tutorial series from the CodeBasics YouTube channel, I progressively improved the code, making it more modular and concise.

## Features

- **Smooth Gameplay**: The snake moves seamlessly on the screen.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game logic is organized into multiple classes for better code readability and maintenance.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Randomly spawning food items increase the snake's length.
- **GUI with Pygame**: Visual representation of the game using Pygame's rendering capabilities.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

## Learning Outcomes

- **OOP Principles**: Applied key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Pygame Fundamentals**: Gained hands-on experience with Pygame for developing graphical applications.
- **Code Optimization**: Learned how to refactor code to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
- **Problem-Solving**: Enhanced debugging skills by identifying and fixing gameplay logic issues.
